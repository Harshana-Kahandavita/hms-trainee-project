There was a wide variety of dishes available, and most of them were flavorful and well-prepared. From the appetizers to the desserts, everything seemed fresh and thoughtfully presented. I especially enjoyed the main course options, which offered a good mix of vegetarian and non-vegetarian items.\n\nThe ambience, however, was just average. The lighting and decor were basic, and while the seating was comfortable enough, the overall atmosphere didn’t feel particularly cozy or special. It felt more functional than inviting.\n\nOne downside was how crowded the restaurant was. It was a busy evening, and the place felt a bit cramped. At times, it was difficult to navigate between tables or get quick service due to the number of people. This did impact the overall dining experience slightly, especially when trying to go for refills at the buffet.\n\nDespite that, if you're mainly looking for a good variety of tasty food at a reasonable price, this place delivers. I’d consider returning on a less busy night to better enjoy the meal and setting.",

We stopped by for their high tea, and while the setting was impressive, the overall experience was just okay. The tea itself was fine—good, but nothing particularly special in terms of variety or flavor. The high tea platters, while nicely presented, took 45 minutes to arrive, which felt quite long considering the setting and expectations.\n\nService was just okay. I had to ask multiple times for water refills and for items like milk for the tea, which really should be offered proactively in a high-end hotel. These small details—like refilling water without needing to ask—are what I would have expected at a place like The Kingsbury, but they were missing here.\n\nThat said, the ambiance is what makes it worth a visit. The hotel is gorgeous, and the pool area is especially nice. If you’re visiting, consider the pool day pass for $15 per person for 3 hours—it’s a great way to relax. The poolside tavern is a good spot for a drink or snack.\n\nOverall, the high tea is decent but not exceptional. Worth it for the setting, but service could definitely be improved",

The location itself was beautiful, and the food was great, making it an ideal spot for a laid-back day. However, our experience was unfortunately marred by a few issues with the staff, particularly at the bar.\n\nThere was a staff member named Nishantha who, unfortunately, left a negative impression. His manner of speaking to customers was unprofessional, and it felt like he was treating us poorly. We were simply asking for an afternoon snack, but instead of helping, he directed us to different locations and asked us to join a queue for an event hosted by another company. When we followed his instructions, we were then told that we could not get the snack, and were sent back to the bar. This back-and-forth felt confusing and frustrating.\n\nWhen we tried to explain the situation to Nishantha, his response was dismissive and rude, making us feel as though we were begging for something that should have been a simple request. We were visiting Sri Lanka from the UK, and my sister and her family came all the way from Australia. This visit was meant to be a special memory for us, but the lack of proper training and communication from certain staff members really took away from the experience.\n\nIt’s such a shame, because with the right customer service, this could have been a truly wonderful day. We hope the hotel provides more training to its staff on how to properly communicate and treat guests, especially in a place with such a strong reputation.",

Some rooms, mainly the bottom floor rooms, do have problems with ants, but the staff will come to quickly resolve it when notified. The AC blows cold which is great! The view from the rooms is okay, a small pond borders a number of the rooms however staying on the balcony isn’t that easy due to the mosquitoes that come from the pond. The water pressure from the showers could be improved. There is complimentary fruit plates that are served through the time there, great way to try the local fruit options! All organically grown. Very tasty!\n\nThe food options are great and there is quite a verity to choose from. Breakfast buffet has a number of different options including both western style and Sri Lankan style.\n\nThe pool and bar area is beautiful and is great to relax by. The area is well maintained.\n\nThe property itself is situated in one of the more rural towns/cities. It’s about 30km or so from the airport which could be a 30min or 1hr drive depending on the traffic and time of day. To get to the nearest highway entrance, you must drive to Kadawatha which is about 20mins away.",

I would never, never, never recommend this place to anyone.\n\nTo begin with, when we requested a dental kit at the reception, we were told it was chargeable—a basic amenity that most hotels offer complimentary. Then, without explanation, the kit was sent to the room anyway. Similarly, we had to request tea and coffee supplies multiple times, which should have already been provided in the room.\n\nWe arrived in the evening expecting a dinner buffet, as mentioned in our booking and payment. But shockingly, there was no buffet at all. Instead, we were simply told to choose between vegetable biryani or non-veg biryani. Buffet\n\nwas denied and we were offered a set menu.That was it—no starters, no sides, no dessert, nothing. It felt like an afterthought or leftovers rather than a properly planned meal. What kind of 4-star hotel does this?\n\nThe room itself was average, but several basic issues made the stay even worse:\n\nThe washroom door lock didn’t work, causing significant discomfort.\n\nThere was no fridge in the room, and when we informed them we had items like cold drinks and yoghurt that needed refrigeration, we were told, \"You can keep your items in our fridge.\" Only after repeated insistence did they say a fridge would be moved to our room—but that would only happen the next morning!\n\nEvery time we raised a concern, all we heard was \"sorry\"—but only by mouth, not by heart. If those apologies had come from genuine concern, the same problems wouldn't have kept repeating.\n\nThe service was poor, the staff indifferent, and the hospitality non-existent. No courtesy, no ownership, no sense of professional responsibility.\n\nFor a hotel carrying the Best Western brand name, this place is a complete embarrassment. *It borders on false advertising and should be seriously investigated for misrepresentation*.\n\n*Never again. Never recommend. Avoid at all costs*.\n\nThe following pictures show the complete breakfast. And many things but stale and dry.",

He is a person who does not fit in that place. But all the other officials and staff provided us with very good service. We will come back to this Ambalama resort. I do not expect such inconvenience again.",

The hotel is surrounded by lush greenery, creating a peaceful and relaxing atmosphere perfect for anyone looking to escape the hustle and bustle of daily life.\n\nUsed to stay at cottage named “kubalge”and it was clean, spacious, and well-maintained, offering a comfortable stay with all the necessary amenities. The staff was incredibly friendly and attentive, always making sure that we had everything we needed. Their warm hospitality truly made us feel great.\n\nThe food was another highlight of our stay. The restaurant & bar served delicious Sri Lankan cuisine, and every meal was fresh and flavorful. Their mixological artistry is truly commendable,we thoroughly enjoyed their cocktails.\n\nThe hotel also has a beautiful swimming pool, which was perfect for unwinding after a long day. Additionally, its location near Leisure World Water Park made it easy to enjoy some fun activities nearby.\n\nOverall, Ambalama Leisure Lodge is a best place for those seeking a peaceful retreat with great service, delicious food, and beautiful surroundings. I would highly recommend it to anyone visiting the area!",

There were no lights in the walking path. Started to smell badly the more you get closer to the cottage. The bed linen was dirty and filthy, and cocroaches were found on the floor. Mouldy walls and non AC rooms for the price quoted left us no choice at late night. We requested a refund as we had no choice but to find another accommodation at night. The reception person had no idea of doing where he had to call his manager as he was rejecting to give the refund. Shantha, who appeared to be the manager, had no sense of customer service where he started speaking like we did them wrong.  The exact words were, \"we can't do anything now as we lost other business also because of you, so can not refund.\"\nAt last, we had to go on an argument to get our money back as he tried to hold our deposit forcefully. Then Shantha revealed himself as the Housekeeping manager where he could not take any decisions on the refund. We were speechless that after all these conversations, he appeared not the relevant manager to handle the situation. At last, we got our refund and asked me to sign on a blank paper as they could not find the refund reciepts. Which ended us up more frustrated. 😡\nThis is the worst way to do your business, and I would not recommend anyone to go to this place. Our friends reunion was ruined because of them. Around 2200hrs we were at road still looking for places to stay ......... 😓",

The staff were very friendly and helpful. There is limited parking. Someone was parked in the only spot in front of the hotel, so they had what looked like a house across the street they had us park there.

We opted for the full board package (FB), expecting a comfortable and enjoyable stay, but it turned out to be a poor value for the money spent.\n\nTo begin with, the hotel offers a fixed menu with very limited variety – only three meal options were available. What made it worse was that both lunch and dinner menus were nearly identical, leaving no room for culinary excitement. The food lacked flavor and quality, and overall did not justify the price charged.\n\nThe room we stayed in was also underwhelming. It lacked the comfort and amenities one would expect at this price point. Adding to the disappointment, the hotel is located in a congested area, surrounded by residential houses, which took away from the sense of privacy and relaxation we were hoping for. There’s also very limited space within the property, making it feel more like a guest house than a hotel.\n\nCustomer service was another major letdown. There was no proper communication system available to contact the reception from the room – something that should be a basic feature in any hotel. The staff seemed untrained and were not particularly attentive or welcoming, which further affected our overall impression.\n\nGiven all of the above, we wouldn’t recommend Blue Elephant Hotel to anyone looking for a relaxing and worthwhile stay. There are certainly better options available that offer far greater value, better service, and a more satisfying experience overall.",

We booked a 2-night stay (room only) and confirmed the price twice over the phone — Rs. 14,000 in both calls. The manager himself gave us this rate.\n\nWe informed them ahead of time that we would be checking in late (around 10:30 PM) due to a dinner event. The manager agreed without any issue. But when we arrived, a staff member asked us to pay Rs. 19,700 — a massive and unexplained increase.\n\nWhen we questioned the difference, the staff member checked with the manager (who was outside) and returned saying the higher price was due to check-in hours being 9 AM–5 PM. This made no sense, as we never booked a day-use package. We asked to speak directly to the manager, but he refused to come inside and just told the staff: “That’s the price.”\n\nEventually, we went outside to speak to him ourselves, and he casually admitted that he quoted Rs. 14,000 — but then said “now this is the price, if you can’t pay…” and told staff to “call another customer and give the room.” This was shocking.\n\nThe junior staff were kind and apologized, asking us to stay just for one night, but we couldn’t accept the manager’s arrogant and unethical behavior. Even though it was late, we found a much better place nearby — something he clearly didn’t expect us to manage.\n\nThis feels like a bait-and-switch tactic. It also seems some of the positive reviews may not be genuine, as even staff were openly speaking about how difficult it is to work with this manager. After sharing our experience with friends, a few of them reported similar or even worse situations involving him.\n\nIf you expect professional hospitality, this is not the place. I hope the top management seriously looks into the conduct of this manager before more customers are driven",
